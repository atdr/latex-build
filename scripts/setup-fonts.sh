#   its own tree, not as system fonts, so fontconfig (which XeTeX and
#   LuaTeX ask to resolve a font name) does not know about them until that
#   tree is registered.
# - Arial and the other Microsoft core fonts are not part of TeX Live at
#   all; they come from the ttf-mscorefonts-installer package instead.
#
# Run after TeX Live is installed and on PATH. Needs apt; works both on the
# runner (via sudo) and as root inside a container (e.g. the full TeX Live
# image used to regenerate texlive-packages.txt).
